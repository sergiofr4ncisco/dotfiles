# sergiofr4ncisco dotfiles

My main goal with this repository is to show how I set up my environment and use GitHub as a central repository to keep my files available whenever and wherever I need it.
Since July 2019 I'm only using macOS, so I can only guarantee they'll work on a Mac.

## Home

**Operating System**: macOS (since August/2018)

**Terminal**: [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/)
