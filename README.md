# Sergio Francisco's .files

These are the personal settings files used by Sergio Francisco in a daily basis. My main goal with this repository is to show how I set up my environment and use Github as a central to keep my files accessibles whenever and wherever I need it.

I am running on Linux Fedora 23.
